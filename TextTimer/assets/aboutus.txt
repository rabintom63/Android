Texting has become one of the primary methods utilized for business and personal communications.  We aim to make texting more effective by simply adding the convenience of being able to send a text at exactly the right time.  After brainstorming about ways to improve our own businesses we came up with TextTime.  Sending a text after business hours or at a time that is not close to the timing of an event can significantly reduce its effectiveness and may not be appropriate.   Now you can send that idea you had at midnight and have it arrive to its intended recipient exactly when you want it to arrive.   Missed appointments, payments, meetings, and assignments can be significantly reduced in a quick and cost effective way.  This app is also perfect for the people who want to send out that happy birthday or anniversary text right at midnight, remind your spouse about soccer practice pickup, or even the party reminder to all their friends for the following week. The uses are unlimited.  Whenever something is on your mind you will never forget to send that text again!  Version two is already underway and will include new tools to help businesses and groups!
